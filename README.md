# Dice Rolling made with LÖVE

## What is this?

This is a simple program that will allow you to play a rolling dice game with the CPU. It'll provide you a simple GUI where you will have to click with your mouse to roll.
That's a simple example of what LÖVE is able to do. I've used a sreference the book [*Developing Games on the Raspberry Pi: App Programming with Lua and LÖVE*](https://www.amazon.it/Developing-Games-Raspberry-Pi-Programming-ebook/dp/B07M8NG4R9).
The exaple in the book had, also, several errors in the code that i've corrected. I hope i'll be able in the future to drop something a little bit more complicated.
Thanks to everybody!
